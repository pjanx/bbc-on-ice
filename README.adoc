bbc-on-ice
==========

'bbc-on-ice' is a SHOUTcast (ICY protocol) bridge for BBC radio streams.
It adds metadata to the stream so that media players can display it.  There are
some inherent technical limitations to how accurate the information can be
but it's definitely better to have an approximate title than nothing.

Packages
--------
Regular releases are sporadic.  git master should be stable enough.  You can get
a package with the latest development version from Archlinux's AUR.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: go

 $ git clone https://git.janouch.name/p/bbc-on-ice.git
 $ cd bbc-on-ice
 $ go build

or, if you know what you're doing:

 $ go install janouch.name/bbc-on-ice@master

To run the local server:

 $ ./bbc-on-ice :8000

Streams have URLs in the following form, derived from
https://gist.github.com/bpsib/67089b959e4fa898af69fea59ad74bc3[this list]:

 $ mpv http://localhost:8000/ww/96000/bbc_radio_one
 $ mpv http://localhost:8000/uk/320000/bbc_1xtra

Socket activation
-----------------
The provided bbc-on-ice.service and bbc-on-ice.socket should do, just change
the `ExecStart` path as needed and place the files appropriately.  Then:

 $ systemctl enable bbc-on-ice.socket
 $ systemctl start bbc-on-ice.socket
