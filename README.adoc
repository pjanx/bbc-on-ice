bbc-on-ice
==========

'bbc-on-ice' is a SHOUTcast (ICY protocol) bridge for BBC radio streams.
It adds metadata to the stream so that media players can display it.

Packages
--------
Regular releases are sporadic.  git master should be stable enough.  You can get
a package with the latest development version from Archlinux's AUR.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, go

 $ git clone --recursive https://git.janouch.name/p/bbc-on-ice.git
 $ mkdir bbc-on-ice/build
 $ cd bbc-on-ice/build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:

 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:

 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i bbc-on-ice-*.deb
